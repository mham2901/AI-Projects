# Mini-Project: Linear Regression
(Forest Fire Prediction)

This mini-project aims to explore the learning of linear and non-linear prediction functions using the least squares method and regularized least squares. The evaluation of this prediction is performed on real-world datasets (Biomedical, Energy, Finance, etc.).

Data Description
For this mini-project, we consider the "Forest Fire Prediction" dataset.
The file forestfires.csv contains several variables.
